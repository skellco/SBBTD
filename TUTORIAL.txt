The following software is required by the SBB learning algorithm:

	scons
	make 
	g++ 
	jdk
	libbz2-dev

Additional software for task domains:

	java development kit and runtime environment

RoboCup only:

	rcssserver-15.2.2 https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/rcssserver/
	rcssmonitor https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/rcssmonitor/
	boost
	flex
	bison (bison 2.7 version required)
