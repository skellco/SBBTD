[Update July 19, 2016: This distribution now includes both task domains: Half Field Offense and Ms. Pacman. The TUTORIAL.txt file is being rewritten accordingly.]

Symbiotic Bid-Based GP (SBB) is a hierarchical framework for coevolving teams 
of simple programs. SBBTD is an extension of the original c++ code for 
reinforcement learning tasks, with additional support for transfer learning and task-agnostic diversity mechanisms.

This code was developed primarily to evolve agent behaviours for Half Field Offense (Robocup 2D Soccer) and Ms. Pac-Man. Animations of behaviours in each domain, which illustrate how the modular GP strategies support decision making during gameplay, can be viewed at the following links:
